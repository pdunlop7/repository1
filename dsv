i just need to count the number of PTS ID's that have a PTS Status of "Award Issued" and do not have a 4cast status of "Withdrawn" or "Pending Withdrawal".

Awarded Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('PTS raw'[PTS ID]),
    'PTS raw'[PTS Status (Phase 2)] = "Award Issued",
    NOT('PTS raw'[4CAST Status (PTS)] IN {"Withdrawn", "Pending Withdrawal"}),
    FILTER(
        '4CAST raw',
        '4CAST raw'[4Cast ID Number (4CAST)] = 'PTS raw'[4Cast ID Number (PTS)] &&
        NOT('4CAST raw'[4CAST Status] IN {"Withdrawn", "Pending Withdrawal"})
    )
)
